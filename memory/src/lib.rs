//! This library contains various common utilities for writing target-specific memory lowering passes.
//!
//! Target-specific memory lowering passes are organized roughly as follows:
//!
//! - for each memory in the design:
//!   - a list of candidate lowerings is assembled:
//!     - if a lowering mode (ff / lutram / blockram / hugeram) is explicitly selected, only the relevant
//!       target cells types are considered
//!     - for each available type of target cell:
//!       - hard requirements are checked, and the target cell is rejected if they are unmet, eg:
//!         - memories with more write ports than the target cell are rejected
//!         - memories with asynchronous read ports are rejected if not supported by target cell
//!       - a set of candidate "swizzle" transformations is assembled, for rearranging the memory geometry
//!         to match the target cell
//!         - the candidate swizzles are created according to target-specific rules, with some help from
//!           common functions for eg. legalizing write mask granularity
//!       - the best swizzle is selected, according to some metric (such as inserted soft mux depth or number
//!         of used target cells)
//!       - when a memory needs to be split/duplicated because of excessive read port count, each of the
//!         split/duplicated sub-memories will have its own swizzle
//!       - if a swizzle is egregiously bad (uses more resources than the entire FPGA has available), it is
//!         rejected
//!     - if applicable, a "fallback" lowering candidate is inserted into the list of candidates
//!       - no fallback lowering if multiple write port domains present
//!       - lowering to FFs for RAMs (very expensive)
//!       - lowering to LUTs for ROMs (somewhat expensive)
//!   - if no candidates are available, synthesis is aborted with a fatal error
//!   - one of the candidate lowerings is picked, according to some target-specific heuristic
//!     - initial heuristic will simply switch between target cells based on memory depth
//!     - in the future, we will want to take target resource counts into account (moving the depth threshold
//!       to avoid overfilling the FPGA)
//!   - if the "fallback" lowering candidate has been selected, the common lowering code is called to perform it
//!   - otherwise, target cell lowering is performed:
//!     - the memory is split into sub-memories (using common code), as required to satisfy max read port count,
//!       then each sub-memory is processed independently
//!     - various fixup transformations (implemented in common code, but driven by target code) are performed on
//!       the memory to match it with target cell capabilities:
//!       - sync read ports are converted to async if required
//!       - read port enable / clear / reset / initial value are unmapped and emulated if not supported
//!       - transparency is unmapped and emulated if not supported
//!       - read-first relations are emulated if not supported
//!     - the swizzle (computed earlier) is applied to the memory (using common code), aligning its geometry
//!       with the target cell
//!     - the memory is consumed and converted into actual target cells
//!     - any target-specific post-processing (such as merging output pipeline registers) is performed

/// Describes a "swizzle" transformation, used to align memory geometry to target requirements.
///
/// This structure is constructed by the target, with some help from common code.
///
/// The swizzle transformation involves the following steps:
///
/// 1. The data swizzle is applied to the write data, write mask, and read data signals.  This is used
///    to insert dummy data bits to ensure that target cell's write mask granularity requirements are met.
///
/// 2. The address bits selected by `soft_addr_bits_mask` are removed from all ports, and implemented using soft
///    logic.  This has the following effects:
///
///    - memory depth is divided by two (for each removed address bit)
///    - memory width is multiplied by two (for each removed address bit)
///    - for each write port:
///      - if the removed address bit was implicit (as part of a wide port), the port width doesn't change
///      - otherwise, the port width is multiplied by two, and a mux is inserted
///    - for each write port:
///      - if the removed address bit was implicit (as part of a wide port), the port width doesn't change
///      - otherwise, the port width is multiplied by two, and write mask is adjusted with address decoding logic
///
///    This part of the transformation is used to deal with memories that have excessively asymmetric port widths.
///
/// 3. The `wide_log2` of every write port is adjusted up to the factor requested in `write_wide_log2`, by doubling
///    port width and inserting write address decode logic as necessary.  It is an error if the requested factor
///    is smaller than the current one (after applying step #2).
///
///    This is used for funny cases like iCE40 memories, which require using 16-bit write ports to have per-bit
///    write masks.
///
/// 4. The `wide_log2` of every read port is adjusted up to the factor requested in `read_wide_log2`, by doubling
///    port width and inserting muxes as necessary.  It is an error if the requested factor is smaller than the
///    current one (after applying step #2).
///
///    This is used for obscure cases requiring a *minimum* port width asymmetry such as the Xilinx `RAM64X8SW` cell.
///
/// 5. The memory depth is adjusted to be at most `2 ** hard_addr_bits`.  Further, all read and write ports are
///    adjusted to have an address signal that is exactly `hard_addr_bits - port.wide_log2()` bits.
///
///    If the memory has larger depth than this limit, it is split up into `2 ** hard_addr_bits`-deep chunks,
///    the chunks are assembled "side-by-side" (converting depth to width), and appropriate read multiplexers
///    and write address decoders are inserted.
///
/// 6. The memory is cut along its width, into `data_width_unit`-sized chunks, which are returned as individual
///    [`Memory`] structures.  The last chunk is padded with dummy bits.
